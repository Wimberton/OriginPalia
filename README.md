A multi-purpose tool for Palia, written in C++. Open source for non-commercial usage, looking for contributors.

OriginPalia comes packed with general enhancements like Instant Fishing, ESPs, Silent Aim, Teleport to entities, and more. OriginPalia is still in active development, there may be a few bugs.

Big thanks to @klukule for their [Palia ESP DX11 / DX12 source on GitHub](https://github.com/klukule/PaliaHook). Without that, I wouldn't have taken the time to build something from it.

Thanks to @VoidPollo for the continued work, restructuring, and mainteinace! A real CHAD in the team! Couldn't do this without you!

## Aimbots & Fun:

- Enable Legacy Aimbot *(work-in-progress / camera boom angle changes when aiming. Working on predictive angle offsetting during this bow transition)*
- Aim Smoothing slider *(makes your aim less sticky. Easier to target other animals)*
- Aim Offset Adjustment draggable grid *(should help adjust the issue with bow aiming camera boom changes for now)*
- Enable InteliAim Circle *(FOV circle with advanced targeting functionality based on entity scoring)*

- Teleport Target entity to you *(bottom mouse button)*
- Teleport Dropped Loot To Player *(automatically teleport all dropped loot to your player to gather)*

- Selectable Movement Modes *(Walking, Flying, Fly No Collision) (another way to mess with your movement types)*
- Global Game Speed slider *(changes your global game speed [timescale mod])*

- Custom quantity input

## Locations & Coordinates:
- Display current coordinates *(use these coordinates to perform certain actions)*
- List of teleport locations *(a good list of easily teleportable locations to efficiently perform tasks such as shopping, repairing, etc)*
- Custom coordinate input *(enter or get custom coordinates to perform certain actions)*
- Buttons for teleport actions *(teleport home, to locations, and other actions)*

## Pickable Locations
- Display a list of currently pickable items
- Teleport to pickable items

## Building
You will need to dump the SDK of the game yourself in order for this to work. Simply add the latest game SDK files into the `PaliaSDK` folder to reallocate the required SDK files.

### Dependencies (included):
